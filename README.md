# mw-grid

Development of the Museums and the web conference site, based on content from http://mw2016.museumsandtheweb.com/

Most of responsive grid is in place, largely using flexbox for layout, to ensure elements align correctly

Menu needs more work, probably better done within wordpress at this point.
